# My First Webpage Design

Welcome this project was designed to be an autobiography of my journey with [CodeInstitute](https://codeinstitute.net)

The following webpage was written by me although i did have some assistance from the tutor support and mentor support along with student support.

the webpages i used to help me do the following are:

<ol>
<li>Google</li>
<li>Repl.it</li>
<li>W3schools website for colors and fonts</li>
</ol>


The idea behind this design is to show what ive learnt and just some of what is new to me the image is https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pngitem.com%2Fso%2Fcss3-logo%2F&psig=AOvVaw0pHEYTC2afuvFpIrH8ss7d&ust=1628441044658000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCIjPwOKtn_ICFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD
