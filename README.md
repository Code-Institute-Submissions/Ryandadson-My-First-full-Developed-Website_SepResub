# My First Webpage Design

Welcome this project was designed to be an autobiography of my journey with [CodeInstitute](https://codeinstitute.net)

The following webpage was written by me although i did have some assistance from the tutor support and mentor support along with student support.

the webpages i used to help me do the following are:

<ol>
<li>Google</li>
<li>Repl.it</li>
<li>W3schools website for colors and fonts</li>
</ol>


The idea behind this design is to show what I have learnt so far. what this is meant to represent is the journey I have taken with code institute in a way of learning something new with the hopes that something like this can be used to attract others into checking out the program. with the links below will show how the code is validated and where all the imagery is sourced from tyhe help i used to get to this point and a basic understanding behind the idea.
